## Key Concepts Across All Documents

### 1. MVC Architecture

- **Model**: `functions/` - Business logic
- **View**: `gui/` - User interface
- **Controller**: `constants/` - Configuration

### 2. Component-Based Design

- Reusable UI components
- Consistent interfaces (`get_widget()`)
- Self-contained functionality

### 3. Screen Management

- Cached screens for fast switching
- `create_screen()` pattern
- Navigation system

### 4. Threading Model

- Main thread for GUI
- Worker threads for operations
- `frame.after()` for thread-safe updates

### 5. Configuration Management

- Centralized in `AppConfig`
- No hardcoded values
- Easy customization
